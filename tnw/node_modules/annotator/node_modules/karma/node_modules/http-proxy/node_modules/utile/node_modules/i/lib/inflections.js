// A singleton instance of this class is yielded by Inflector.inflections, which can then be used to specify additional
// inflection rules. Examples:
//
//     BulletSupport.Inflector.inflect ($) ->
//       $.plural /^(ox)$/i, '$1en'
//       $.singular /^(ox)en/i, '$1'
//
//       $.irregular 'octopus', 'octopi'
//
//       $.uncountable "equipment"
//
// New rules are added at the top. So in the example above, the irregular rule for octopus will now be the first of the
// pluralization and singularization rules that is runs. This guarantees that your rules run before any of the rules that may
// already have been loaded.

// Specifies a new pluralization rule and its replacement. The rule can either be a string or a regular expression.
// The replacement should always be a string that may include reference
